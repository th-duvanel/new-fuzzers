# Use of existing TLS fuzzer for SPDM development

Git repo for development of a SPDM fuzzer using a TLS pre-existing one.

## About

This repo has two parts: the pre testing for already existing fuzzers for TLS, with the aim of finding the one with highest perfomance.
The second part is the fuzzer development itself.

The first part of our project is considered the best undergraduate project on the artefacts trail in the SBSeg 2023 (Simpósio Brasileiro de Segurança da Informação), the Brazilian Security Simposium.
